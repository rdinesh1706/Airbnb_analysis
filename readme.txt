Welcome to my Github Airbnb Analysis repository, This project is done in streamlit application.

The concept of this project is to clean the provided data, treat the null values and converted all data into a proper dataframe then visualize the data in graphs and plots.

Project Title: Airbnb Analysis.

Skills Used: Python scripting, Data Preprocessing, Visualization, git desktop, Streamlit, MongoDb.


Project Explaination:


1) Sign up for a MongoDB Atlas account by visiting the MongoDB Atlas website and follow the registration process to set up your account and create a new project.

2) Within your MongoDB Atlas project, set up a cluster. Choose the cloud provider and region for hosting your data, configure the cluster specifications, and create the cluster. This will serve as the database environment for storing the sample data.

3) Once your cluster is set up, access the MongoDB Atlas dashboard. In the left-hand navigation menu, click on "Database Access" to create a database user with appropriate permissions for accessing and loading data. Then, select "Network Access" to set up IP whitelisting or configure other security measures.

4) From the MongoDB Atlas dashboard, navigate to the "Clusters" page and click on your cluster. In the cluster view, select the "Collections" tab and click on the "Sample Data" button. Choose the "Load Sample Dataset" option, and MongoDB Atlas will import the Airbnb sample data into your cluster. The sample data typically includes collections for listings, reviews, and users.

5) After that we are seperating the data according to our needs

6) Next we are cleaning the data and treating the null values and collecting all the data and converting into a main dataframe

7) with the main dataset we are ploting the data in bar graphs, sunburst, and geo location.
